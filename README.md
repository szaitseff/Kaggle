## Kaggle
This repository contains my code written for Kaggle, primarily in Kaggle kernels as Jupyter Notebooks. 

I concieved of the ***Under the Hood*** series of Kaggle kernels as part of my machine learning training. 
The idea is to implement popular machine learning models in Python/Numpy and compare their performance against a benchmark, 
i.e. a similar model in the machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn or Keras. 
I agree with Andrej Karpathy who wrote in his [blog](http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/): 
"...everything became much clearer when I started writing code."
